## MY reason for the website

I am programming my website to demonstrate that I understand how to structure content using HTML.
I use CSS to style the website and control layout, colors, and overall presentation, showing that I can separate design from structure. 
Building the site myself proves that I know how HTML and CSS work together to create a functional webpage.
I am also using GitHub to manage code versions and track changes throughout development.
Publishing the site through GitHub Pages shows that I understand basic version control and professional development workflows.
